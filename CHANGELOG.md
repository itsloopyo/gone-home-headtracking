# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Smoothing is now two `HeadTracking.cfg` keys instead of one: `LocalSmoothing`
  (default 0.0) applies when the tracker runs on this machine, `RemoteSmoothing`
  (default 0.15) applies when the tracker is a remote device on the network. The
  value is selected per connection from the packet source address and
  re-evaluated whenever the connection changes.
- Removed the `Smoothing` key. Both new keys cover rotation and position, so
  there is no separate position smoothing setting.
- Removed the hidden 0.15 baseline smoothing floor. Local users now get
  zero-latency tracking by default instead of a silently enforced minimum.
- Sample-rate-to-frame-rate interpolation is no longer gated on the smoothing
  value, so local users at smoothing 0.0 keep smooth motion on high-refresh
  displays.

- Update PositionInterpolator tests for bounded extrapolation
- Skip vendor refresh when SHA-256 matches existing copy
- Fix degenerate-input bugs in scanners, projection, and color parser
- Add yaw-mode key and WorldSpaceYaw config options

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-30

### Other

- Sync install scripts to template with /y fix, bump to 1.1.1
- Expand submodule pointer commits in generated changelogs
- Fix /y flag detection and bundle vendored BepInEx in installers
- Cycle tracking mode on PgUp instead of toggling position only
- Use WriteAllBytes for .cmd output to avoid Defender race

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Other

- Sync to shared standards: chord hotkeys, non-interactive release, data-driven detection
- Add anyKey/anyKeyDown stubs to Unity Input

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- Smoother head tracking at high refresh rates. Pulls in cameraunlock-core velocity extrapolation in PoseInterpolator, eliminating the flat spots between tracker samples that were visible on 144Hz+ displays.
- Ships a `launcher-manifest.json` alongside the installer ZIP so the forthcoming CameraUnlock Launcher can drive Install & Play / Uninstall via this mod's existing `install.cmd` / `uninstall.cmd`.

### Fixed

- Build no longer emits MSB3245 "UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule not found" on pre-2017.3 Unity titles. The reference in the shared core csproj is now gated on the DLL actually existing in UnityEnginePath.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-28

### Other

- Skip pose interpolation at zero smoothing to avoid correction stutters
- Remove neck model parameters after core API simplification
- Use camera-relative rotation and fix reticle jitter

### Other

- Switch to view-matrix-only head tracking, remove transform save/restore

### Other

- Use horizon-locked yaw via Rodrigues rotation, remove output smoothing
- Use shared rotation/position helpers, add auto-recenter on tracking loss

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-10

### Other

- Add position toggle hotkey and fix rotation projection
- Apply output smoothing to all connections, not just remote

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-08

First release.
